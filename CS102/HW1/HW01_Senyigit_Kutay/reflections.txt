I added  three extra variable to Hangman class  String[] process, boolean isWon; String[] words;
	I added process array to print proccesing word properly. tryThis method was not working.
	I added isWon boolean to trace whether game over is shown by wining or loosing
	I added words array to take words from text file.

I added two extra methods to Hangman class and these are updateKnownSoFar and readTextFile()

updateKnownSoFar() = 
This method updates the process of the word.
Does not return anything.


readTextFile() = 
This method updates the process of the word.					    
In order to use this method you should change the pathname to where words.txt is exist.
In words.txt file words should be separated with spaces Exp: "game ball".


I fixed some methods according to requirements:


I fixed Trythis method to return "-1" , "-2" , "-3" depending on letter's situations.( if the letter is not valid (-1), if the letter was already used (-2), and indicate if game over (-3).)
I added isKnown boolean to fix numberOfIncorrect tries in Trythis method. 
I fixed isGameOver method to trace whether game over is shown by wining or loosing.
In main method I fixed the bug occurs when the game over. It was not printing the correct answer.
I fixed in constructor to make all chars * at the beginning of the game.
